# fcc-weather_app
Simple weather app - one of the FreeCodeCamp.com challenges.

It works (tested), but it needs your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
It shows the current weather (I mentioned it's simple).
It was designed for low resolution sreens.
You can check it working [_here_](https://codepen.io/tmpbit/full/JyRGNW/) on Codepen.io.
It's first version and probably it will be another one (improved) soon.
